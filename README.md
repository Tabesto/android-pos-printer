# Tabesto POS printer module

## Description

This module allows you to use POS printers easily with your Android application.
With this wrapper module, we can handle printer(s) in a more convenient way, and add some flexibility.



![Global architecture](docs/global-architecture-diagram.png?raw=true "Global architecture")



**NB**: For now, only EPSON and its [ePOS SDK](https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=single_soft&cid=6547&scat=61&pcat=52) is supported by the module.



## Features

- **Print** on **one** or **many** printer simultaneously.
- **Customize ticket content** to print.
- **Connect**, **disconnect** printers dynamically.
- Retrieve printer **status** on demand.
- **Discover** dynamically printers around (bluetooth only).



## Installation

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```



Add the dependency in your module build.gradle, with the last version available [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Tabesto/android-pos-printer.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Tabesto/android-pos-printer) :

```groovy
dependencies {
  	...
  	implementation 'com.github.Tabesto:android-pos-printer:{lastVersion}'
	}
```

    Timber.plant(Timber.DebugTree())
}
```
