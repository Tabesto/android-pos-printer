# Tabesto POS printer module

## Description

This module allows you to use POS printers easily with your Android application.
With this wrapper module, we can handle printer(s) in a more convenient way, and add some flexibility.
For information, present module is currently used in production with all our customers.



![Global architecture](docs/global-architecture-diagram.png?raw=true "Global architecture")



**NB**: For now, only EPSON and its [ePOS SDK](https://download.epson-biz.com/modules/pos/index.php?page=single_soft&cid=6547&scat=61&pcat=52) is supported by the module.



## Features

- [x]  **Print** on **one** or **many** printer simultaneously.
- [x] **Customize ticket content** to print.
- [x] **Connect**, **disconnect** printers dynamically.
- [x] Retrieve printer **status** on demand.
- [ ] **Discover** dynamically printers around (bluetooth only). [Planned in future roadmap]



## Installation

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```



Add the dependency in your module build.gradle, with the last version available [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Tabesto/android-pos-printer.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Tabesto/android-pos-printer) :

```groovy
dependencies {
  	...
  	implementation 'com.github.Tabesto:android-pos-printer:{lastVersion}'
	}
```



By default, all architectures are available for the native Epson SDK and embedded in the printer library. If you have specific devices to target and want to optimize your APK size, you can filter the architectures to embed only specific ones (see the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/gradle-external-native-builds#specify-abi) for more information) :

```groovy
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    ndk {
      // Specifies the ABI configurations of your native
      // libraries Gradle should build and package with your APK.
      abiFilters 'x86', 'x86_64', 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a','arm64-v8a'
    }
  }
}
```

## Logs

If you want to see the library logs inside your application, just plant a [Timber Tree](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) :

```kotlin
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Timber.plant(Timber.DebugTree())
}
```



## Usage

See `sample` application.
